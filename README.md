# 3D Geometry Deep Learning for Cardiovascular Metabolic Risk Prediction
Map 3D geometry information to 2D. Train the 2D embedded maps with convolutional neural networks to predict health related bio-marker.  

## Overview

## Information Mapping
We propose to unify the 3D geometry space with the 2D image space for each individual body shape sample to make 3D geometry trainable in a convolutional neural network.The unified 3D-2D space aims to transform arbitrary 3D geometry into a representation that lossless convertible between 3D and 2D space.
